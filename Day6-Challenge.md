# Problem Statement

Design a student database using classes. The fields of the database must include: Student ID, Name, Class, Section and Total marks(out of 500). Implement an array which stores 5 student records(objects). The input to access these records is the array index number and the output will be all the field for the selected student.
The data must be already filled with data and this program should not take any input data except for a query from the user.

## Example

### Input:
                5
         
### Output:
                Student ID   Name   Class   Section   Total Marks
                1            John   12      A.        490
